# Beautiful Days at the Movies

## Problem

Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse. For instance, given the number **12**, its reverse is **21**. Their difference is **9**. The number **120** reversed is **21**, and their difference is **99**.

She decides to apply her game to decision making. She will look at a numbered range of days and will only go to a movie on a beautiful day.

Given a range of numbered days, **[i...j]** and a number **k**, determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful. Beautiful numbers are defined as numbers where **|i-reverse(i)|** is evenly divisible by **k**. If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Print the number of beautiful days in the range.

Given the arrival time of each student and a threshhold number of attendees, determine if the class is canceled.
